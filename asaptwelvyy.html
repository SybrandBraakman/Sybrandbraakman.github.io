     <h1>5/10</h1> 
      <h3>I would give this album 5/10 because of how lacking it has been in comaprison to A$AP Twelvyy's peers in the Mob. Very decent at the very least. 
           </h3>
    12 dropped in August of 2017, which was the debut album of A$AP Mob's latest addition in terms of solo albums. This album was very decent and really was nnot bad at all for Twelvyy's first, but was a let down in comaprison to both Ferg and Rocky shich show greater skill and styler. This shows potential though as his next album realy could be a great work.
