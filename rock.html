      <h1>7/10</h1> 
      <h3>I would give this album an 8/10 because although it was good, it did not live up to the hype of his first album. 

     This Album is the Second From A$AP Rocky, it dropped in mid 2015. This album boasted songs like Lord Pretty Flaco Jodye 2 and Canal St. which are both great songs which both speak to the past of A$AP Rocky. This album is sound stylistically but really does not bring anything new to the table which is why it is a 7/10.
